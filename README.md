## Description

This Cordova / PhoneGap plugin enables displaying mobile Ads with single line of javascript code. Designed for the use in HTML5-based cross-platform hybrid games and other applications.

This version is used with Firebase, and compatible with other plugins using Firebase, such as FCM.

If you don't plan to include Firebase in your app, use the standalone version cordova-plugin-admobpro.

## History

Community-driven project. Designed and maintained by [Raymond Xie](http://github.com/floatinghotpot/) since August 2014. It also features integration in AngularJS projects via [ngCordova] (http://www.ngcordova.com).

It was published to Cordova registry with id "com.google.cordova.admob" since Aug 2014, and  has been downloaded more than 120,000 times. Now it's the No. 1 monetization plugin for Cordova community.

What's difference of these plugin IDs, which one shall I use ?
* com.google.cordova.admob
* cordova-plugin-admob
* cordova-plugin-admobpro
* cordova-plugin-admobpro-firebase

Read: [Difference of Plugin ID](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro/wiki/Difference-of-Plugin-IDs)

Notice:
* If build locally using ```cordova-plugin-admobpro```, to avoid build error, you need install some extras in Android SDK manager (type ```android sdk``` to launch it):
![android extra](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2339512/8176143/20533ec0-1429-11e5-8e17-a748373d5110.png)

## Usage

Show Mobile Ad with single line of javascript code.

Step 1: Create Ad Unit Id for your banner and interstitial, in [AdMob portal](http://www.admob.com/), then write it in your javascript code.

```javascript
// select the right Ad Id according to platform
  var admobid = {};
  if( /(android)/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) { // for android & amazon-fireos
    admobid = {
      banner: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/xxx', // or DFP format "/6253334/dfp_example_ad"
      interstitial: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/yyy'
    };
  } else if(/(ipod|iphone|ipad)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) { // for ios
    admobid = {
      banner: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/zzz', // or DFP format "/6253334/dfp_example_ad"
      interstitial: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/kkk'
    };
  } else { // for windows phone
    admobid = {
      banner: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/zzz', // or DFP format "/6253334/dfp_example_ad"
      interstitial: 'ca-app-pub-xxx/kkk'
    };
  }
```

Step 2: Want cheap and basic banner? single line of javascript code.

```javascript
// it will display smart banner at top center, using the default options
if(AdMob) AdMob.createBanner({
  adId: admobid.banner,
  position: AdMob.AD_POSITION.TOP_CENTER,
  autoShow: true });
```

Step 3: Want interstitial Ad to earn more money ? Easy, 2 lines of code. 

```javascript
// preppare and load ad resource in background, e.g. at begining of game level
if(AdMob) AdMob.prepareInterstitial( {adId:admobid.interstitial, autoShow:false} );

// show the interstitial later, e.g. at end of game level
if(AdMob) AdMob.showInterstitial();
```

Or, you can just copy this [admob_simple.js](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro/blob/master/test/admob_simple.js) to your project, change the ad unit id to your own, and simply reference it in your index.html, like this:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="admob_simple.js"></script>
```

Remember to remove `isTesting:true` if release for production.

## AdMob Mediation Adapters ##

Optional mediations to increase your revenue (Read about [AdMob Mediation Networks](https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/android/mediation-networks)):

cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-admob-unityads
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-admob-inmobi

## Tips

Some important tips, FYI.

- [x] Why Google AdMob is recommended ?

Advertisement is main business and income source of Google, so clients are all around the world. Google is one of the most rialable partners for its high standard service.

* High fill rate, nearly 100% all around world.
* High quality Ad, bring high RPM.
* Stable price, auto pay on time. Pay on every 20th next month.

- [x] Strongly recommend Interstitial, more than 10 times profit than banner Ad. 

Ad Format | Banner | Interstitial
---|-------|--------------
Click Rate | < 1% | 3-15%
RPM (revenue per 1000 impression) |  US$ 0.5~4 | US$ 10~50

- [x] Using SMART_BANNER to auto-fit the screen width, avoid using BANNER or FULL_BANNER (unless you are using DFP)

⚠：Remember Google's slogan: "Don't be evil". Invalid usage violating Google rules, may cause your AdMob account suspended ! 

* AdMob publisher may NOT abuse or encourage abuse any Google products, including Google Play, YouTube or Blogger, incuding allow user downloading YouTube video, or embed YouTube video in your own apps.

* Publishers may NOT click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Testing your own ads by clicking on them is not allowed.

More details, please read [AdMob & AdSense policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en&ref_topic=2745287)

## License

You can use the plugin for free, or you can also pay to get a license. IMPORTANT!!! Before using the plugin, please read the following content and accept the agreement. THIS WILL AVOID POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND DISPUTE.

There are 3 license options, fully up to you:
1. Free and Open Source, no support
2. Commercial, with email/skype support
3. Win-win partnership, with forum support

If you hope to get a fully open source plugin (either need DIY, or hope to get full control on the code), use this open source one instead. Fork and pull request is welcome, but please mention it's derived source. Simply renaming then publishing to npm is forbidden. Open source project URL:
https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-admob

If use in commercial project, please [get a license](http://rjfun.github.io/), or, you have monetized more than $1000 using this plugin, you are also required to either get a commercial license ($20). As a commercial customer, you will be supported with high priority, via private email or even Skype chat.

If you don't want to get a license as your apps may not earn too much, or you don't have a PayPal account to pay, here is a compromised option. You don't have to pay, we are also okay if just share 2 percent user traffic, so that we can cover our effort and focus on maintenance and online support. (We have maintained this project over 3 years, and closed more than 560 support issues)

Please read the [License Agreement](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro/wiki/License-Agreement) for details.
